# Game Play Scenario

Asha Empire is a strategy-based, FPS and RPG game that takes place in a vast and dynamic world. Players will begin on a single planet, but will soon be able to travel to other planets, space stations, and space outposts. The game's safe zones will be monitored by the forces of the empire to ensure players can engage in peaceful interactions without fear of attack.

Players will purchase NFTs that represent the characters they will play as. Each NFT is unique and can be bought, sold, and traded by players. When an NFT is transferred to a new owner, all the character's property, level, and assets are transferred with it.

One of the key features of Asha Empire is the ability to produce and trade goods. Players can extract minerals, produce items in facilities, and sell them in local markets. To access advanced weapons, vehicles, and spaceships, players must attend schools and increase their education level.

Organizations will be another important aspect of the game. Players can establish organizations and manage them with other players. Organizations can have their own territories, cities, and even regions within the game. To maintain their status, organizations must pay taxes to the empire, but the tax revenue will be deposited into their accounts. Organizations can also form alliances and work together to achieve common goals.

Another key aspect of Asha Empire is survival. In order to ensure players can continue their journey, they must obtain life insurance from an insurance company located in the cities. This insurance policy will protect players from permanent death and allow them to revive from their clone. Players who do not have insurance will be reset.

The game also offers opportunities for players to engage in resource gathering and agriculture. Players can extract minerals and produce crops, which they can then sell in the market or use to produce items. When players log out, their characters will automatically enter sleep mode, but must be fed occasionally to ensure their survival.

Asha Empire offers a rich and immersive world for players to explore, with the option to engage in battles with other players in unsafe areas. All trading and transactions within the game will be conducted using the AEC currency, which can be traded and transferred out of the game as a token. The game has no subscription fee, but players must purchase an NFT to play.
